### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 1 was one of favorite labs because I was always curious as to how patterns worked with loops. I enjoyed seeing how the expected outputs are changed with certain combinations. The different loops were great to see and utilise.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 2 was another one of my preferred labs because I enjoyed writing to a file and figuring out the program.Being able to understand how programs essentially "communicate" was a wonderful process with the addition of the output file stream. Using different variables to copy terminal data was also great process.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 2 really intrigued me with the data structures and the creation of the vectors to store population data. I enjoyed figuring out how to organize and store the information of population data onto one vector. My knowledge of modular programming increased and it was great seeing the different elements the program being defined in different files.
